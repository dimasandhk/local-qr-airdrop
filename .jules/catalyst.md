## 2025-02-21 - Preventing Stored XSS in Inline HTML Generation
**Learning:** When using raw strings for HTML template generation in Go (like `fmt.Sprintf`), user-controlled data such as filenames can easily introduce Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if not properly sanitized.
**Action:** Always use `html.EscapeString()` from the `html` package when rendering user-provided input into HTML strings in Go.

## 2025-02-21 - Managing Memory Leaks in Global State
**Learning:** In a long-running app, continuously appending to global state variables (like an `uploadedFiles` slice) without a limit will cause a memory leak.
**Action:** When introducing global state variables for recent items, implement a hard cap (e.g., retaining only the last 10 items) to prevent unbounded memory growth.
## 2025-02-19 - Dark Mode Toggle
**Learning:** Adding lightweight UI features like a Dark Mode toggle is straightforward because the web UI is generated from a single inline HTML string in the Go code.
**Action:** When evaluating future UI changes for Catalyst features, consider inline modifications within `main.go` instead of relying on external static assets or templates for simplicity.
